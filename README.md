This project is a login system that lets users register and use their credentials to log in. We created the system to focus on implementing reliable password policies to demonstrate cybersecurity importance. The system contains recon tools and penetration methods to steal user information. We used this system with three fictional password policies for our project. However, I won't include those policies as users can use the login system for their needs.
