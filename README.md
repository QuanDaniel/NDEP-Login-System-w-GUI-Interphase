This project is a login system that lets users register and use their credentials to log in. We created the system to focus on implementing reliable password policies to demonstrate cybersecurity importance. The system contains recon tools and penetration methods to steal user information. We used this system with three fictional password policies for our project. However, I won't include those policies as users can use the login system for their needs. 
I will include a list of steps below to use the login system for testing purposes. You will need access to your terminal so the GUI can accept user input.
Step 1 - Click the register button and enter username and password credentials and verify that your user file has been created. The file should appear as your username. 
Step 2 - After registering, go back to the main screen and attempt to login. Information is case-sensitive, so be sure you're entering the correct information. If "login success" message is shown on the screen, then your login attempt was successful. If any other message is shown, check for errors such as entering the wrong username or password.
Step 3 - We want to display how we can penetrate and steal user information. First, we want to exit to the main screen and click the scanner button to access the recon tools. Next, you will use the "Username finder" tool to access every file in your python directory to scan for any files that could contain user information. After you have identified an file, you will use the "Username Verify" tool to verify that the file does exist in your directory.
Step 4 - We have now made it to the penetration testing stage. Exit to the main screen and use the "Attack" button to access the attacking tools. I have created a brute force and dictionary attack method. Choose the attack method and enter the file name from Step 3 to penetrate the user file. REMEMBER credentials are case-sensitive, so be cautious while entering information. If the user exists and the attack method finds a password match, the terminal will output a "PASSWORD MATCH" message. If the password doesn't match or the user not found, look for errors made in steps 1-3. If no error was made, you have successfully created a password that our methods can't penetrate. (Brute force method has time constraints and must have a proper CPU to execute an attack for lengthier and more complex passwords. I recommend only use 3-5 character passwords with minimal complexity for testing purposes)
Step 5 - Last, if you have received the "PASSWORD MATCH," exit to the main screen and attempt to login using the username and password that has been returned to you. If login is successful, then the user's accounts have been successfully compromised.
